## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this challenge was to create a product preview card component with a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. Key user requirements were:

Optimal layout for different device screen sizes
Interactive states on hover and focus for all clickable elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project reinforced key CSS and HTML skills, especially in responsive design and custom properties. It also improved my understanding of accessibility practices, such as appropriate alt text and interactive element states.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

Deeper CSS Grid layouts for complex components
Enhanced accessibility and ARIA attributes
Using more dynamic frameworks like React and Next.js for frontend interactivity
